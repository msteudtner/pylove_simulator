    "Object instance for quantum states with certain stabilizer properties. The stabilizers can be known but the state can be a mixed state of density matrices with any combination of syndromes (sign flips of the stabilizers). The range of syndromes can however also be restricted, as would be the case after postselection experiments. The density matrix could be restricted to only hold states in the code space, or even just pure states of it, stored as vectors. As the stabilizers are known, only the logical representation of the states are stored densely, while stabilizers are stored symbolically along with instructions on how the logical representations are obtained.\n",

    "| state | Returns the reconstructed density matrix. If `self.mode == 'all'`, the output is an array of the shape `( *A, *B)`, where `A = (2, 2, 2, ... , 2)` and `B = (2 ** n, 2 ** n)` with `n = self.n_log_qubits` being the number of logical qubits. The idea is that this matrix prompts a density matrix block associated with a syndrome pattern, a tuple `syndr`, by using it as an input; `self.state[syndr]`. If `self.mode == 'code'`, the output is a two-dimensional array: the density matrix block associated with the code space. If `self.mode == 'custom'`, the output is of type dictionary with syndrome patterns as keys. The syndrome patterns are a version of the syndromes specified in the input `block_numbers`, but updated to fit the set of stabilizer generators in `self.stabs`. If `self.mode == 'vector'`, the output is a `numpy.ndarray` vector.|\n",

If `self.qubit_order[m] == n`, where `n` is an integer, then the `m`th physical qubit becomes the `n`th logical qubit. If `self.qubit_order[m] == 'rm'`, then the qubit is removed.|\n",

    "| other_ops | String of characters `'X'`, `'Y'` and `'Z'` indicating the type of Pauli operators fixed by each stabilizer, in addition to `fixed_ops`. To remove the `n`th qubit from a physical operator, it must act trivially on the `n`th qubit. That is, it must act as either the identity or `P`, where `(P, self.fixed_ops[n], self.other_ops[n])`is a permutation of `('X', 'Y', 'Z')`.\n",

    "syndrome patterns constitute shots with which the density matrix is reconstructed. The density matrix itself is block diagonal with respect to stabilizer states of different syndrome patterns, including the code space. The simulation can save any number of these blocks corresponding to different syndrome numbers. Perfect postselection for instance would only require to keep the code space block and the rest can be discarded. The states in every block are logical states of the stabilizer state corresponding to their syndrome pattern. The simulated circuit has two parts, a time evolution / ansatz circuit featuring Pauli string rotation subcircuits and a state preparation routine featuring subcircuits for projective measurements. Besides the stabilizer generators that constrain the system at every point in the circuit, the system is additionally constrained by a number of logical operators (signed Pauli strings) after the state preparation circuit. This extended list of stabilizer generators constrains the state completely, meaning there are as many extended stabilizer generators as there are physical qubits and the computational subspace has zero degrees of freedom. It is possible within this simulator to give the state preparation circuit an entirely new pattern of projective measurements, as long as they span the same eigenspace as the original stabilizers and logical operators.\n",

The subcircuits are placed into the circuit in the order of this sequence.\n",

It has the form `[A, B]`, holding two sublists `A` and `B` where `A` is a list of Pauli operators (`QubitOperators`) including the identity, that together with their respective statistical weight in the next sublist form the error channel's Kraus operators. The Pauli operators have the index `0` as a placeholder for the proper label of the qubit the noise acts on. `B` is a list holding float numbers corresponding to the statistical weights of their respective Pauli operators.|\n",
    "| gate_noise (`list`)| List characterizing the gate noise model. It has the form `[A, B]`, holding two sublists `A` and `B`: `A` is a list of Pauli strings (`QubitOperators`) including the identity, that together with their respective statistical weight in the next sublist form the error channel's Kraus operators.

This list contains the signed Pauli strings in the order the measurement sub-circuits are placed into the circuit before the ansatz/time evolution circuit `quantum_circuit` is run. If `state_prep_circuit` is left empty, the schedule is made from appending the inputs for the parameters `stabilizers` and `logical_operators`. The list is empty by default.|\n",

This parameter decides which blocks of the density matrix to keep, and determines the output format.  `mode='all'` keeps blocks of all syndromes, and returns the reconstructed density matrix as a high-dimensional array that would return a particular block by taking its syndrome pattern as a parameter, see below. `mode='code'` only keeps the code block which is returned as a two-dimensional array. `mode='custom'` keeps only the blocks with syndrome numbers specified in `block_numbers`, and the reconstructed density matrix is returned as a dictionary, with the transformed syndromes as keys. These syndromes are generally different from the ones in `block_numbers` due to a necessary rearrangement of the stabilizer generators, that can be retraced with the other outputs of this routine.|\n",
